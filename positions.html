                    <h2>Postdoctoral Researcher Position</h2>
                    <h5>(Posted in September 2007)</h5>
                    <h3>Nanostructured Thin Films and Coatings</h3>
                    <p>We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher to fill research positions currently available in our research group.  These positions will support our research efforts in the field of thin films/coatings and nanotechnology.  Specifically, the researcher will be involved in the following areas:</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Processes and mechanisms associated with nucleation and growth of oxide thin films in aqueous solutions</li>
                      <li>ZnO-based TFT for flexible substrates</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The first one is the basic research we have been working on for the past few years, and the second one is a new project that will require a wide range of property measurements (mechanical, electrical), as well as fabrication of the devices. Our research focus has been on processing science, microstructure design, and property measurements of thin films and coatings, and current opening is tied up with our existing projects (low-k dielectrics, high-k dielectrics, flexible electronics, electronic packaging, photovoltaics, etc.).</p>
                    <p>Previous experiences with microstructure characterization of materials through various high-resolution microscope techniques will be desirable. The University has recently built the materials characterization lab called "Analytical and Diagnostics Lab" that houses the state-of-the-art new instruments including TEM, SEMs, dual-beam system (SEM+FIB), AFM, ellipsometer, profilometers, XRD, and many others.</p>
                    <p>If you are interested in applying for this position, please email me your CV and including contact information of three references. Also, if you want to know more about the positions, please contact me at the address shown below.</p>
